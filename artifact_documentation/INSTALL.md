Download this file to your computer. Make sure you make note of where you put the file, as you will need it in the next step.

## Loading the virtual machine

Before you can run the virtual machine, you will need to download and install [VirtualBox 6](https://www.virtualbox.org).

Once you've installed VirtualBox, you're ready to load and run the virtual machine.
To load the virtual machine, you will need to import the **CausalTesting_Artifact.ova** file into VirtualBox. You do so as follows:

1. Open VirtualBox.
2. Go to **File > Import Appliance...**
3. Find and select the downloaded virtual machine file (CausalTesting_Artifact.ova). Click **"Continue"**.
4. Leave all the settings as they are and clikc **"Import"**.

Once the virtual machine is imported, it will appear in your VirtualBox Manager as **CausalTesting_Artifact**. You can now start the virtual machine by clicking the green **"Start"** arrow at the top of the VirtualBox Manager (see screenshot below).
