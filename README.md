# Causal Testing Artifact (ICSE 2020)

This is the artifact for the paper *"Causal Testing: Understanding
Defects' Root Causes"*. This artifact replicates the user study setup
used to evaluate our technique, including the supplementary data
collection materials and prototype source code.

## What is included in the artifact?

Our artifact includes the following:

1. A virtual machine file (CausalTesting_Artifact.ova) that contains
the user study setup and source code for the version of Holmes used.

2. Instructions for obtaining and running Holmes on the virtual machine ([INSTALL.md](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/CausalTesting-Artifact_ICSE20/blob/master/INSTALL.md)).

3. The form participants completed as they worked through
each defect in the user study ([Cause-Identification-Form.pdf](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/CausalTesting-Artifact_ICSE20/blob/master/Cause-Identification-Form.pdf)).

4. The post-questionnaire participants filled out as a form of
debriefing following the study ([Evaluation-Questionnaire.pdf](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/CausalTesting-Artifact_ICSE20/blob/master/Evaluation-Questionnaire.pdf))

5. The demographic questionnaire used to gather information about our
   participants background and experience ([Demographic-Questionnaire.pdf](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/CausalTesting-Artifact_ICSE20/blob/master/Demographic-Questionnaire.pdf)).

6. The script used to explain to participants what they would be doing
   during the user study ([User-Study-Script.pdf](https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/CausalTesting-Artifact_ICSE20/blob/master/User-Study-Script.pdf)).

## Where can I obtain the artifact components?

All the above listed artifacts, with the exception of the virtual machine file, are located in this repository.
