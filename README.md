# Causal Testing Artifact (ICSE 2020)

This is the artifact for the paper *"Causal Testing: Understanding
Defects' Root Causes"*. This artifact replicates the user study setup
used to evaluate our technique, including the supplementary data
collection materials.

## What is included in the artifact?

Our artifact includes the following:

1. A virtual machine file (CausalTesting_Artifact.ova) that contains
the user study setup and version of Holmes used.

2. The form participants completed as they worked through
each defect in the user study (Cause-Identification-Form.pdf).

3. The post-questionnaire participants filled out as a form of
debriefing following the study (Evaluation-Questionnaire.pdf)

4. The demographic questionnaire used to gather information about our
   participants background and experience (Demographic-Questionnaire.pdf).

5. The script used to explain to participants what they would be doing
   during the user study (User-Study-Script.pdf).

## Where can I obtain the artifact components?

All the above listed artifacts can be found in the following github
repository:

The **INSTALL.md** file provides details on how to set up and run the
virutal machine. The other components of the artifact are made
available for exploration and re-use.
