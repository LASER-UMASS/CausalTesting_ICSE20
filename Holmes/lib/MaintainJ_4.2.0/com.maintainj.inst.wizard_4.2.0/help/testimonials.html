<h3><i>Incredibly Useful Tool</i></h3>

<p><i>As an IntelliJ user, I thought of sharing my experiences with MaintainJ.
First let me say, this is the fifth tool I evaluated and it will be the
last. Why, because this one works! The other tools cost several thousand
dollars and only create sequence diagrams from static source code, which
is completely useless for complex code. If you want to learn what is really
happening in your code, this is the product to use. Not only does the
MaintainJ work very well, but all of my questions were answered by
technical experts. I am very happy to recommend such a useful product.
Great Job to all those at MaintainJ.  Keep up the good work. </i></p>

<h3><i>A very useful tool for a challenging problem!</i></h3>

<p><i>MaintainJ 
has proved to be a very useful tool for a challenging problem. Our team was 
assigned the glamorous task of identifying business rules from Java code, 
developed and evolved over a period of 10 years. The initial attempt at doing 
this by just viewing the code did not yield the optimal results plus the task 
quickly lost its appeal. :-). </i></p>

<p><i>The 
MaintainJ trace capability enabled the team to identify specific paths within 
the code base, and use the sequence diagrams to navigate the code to identify 
and document rules. Version 3.0 provided the additional context data, that added 
further value to what we were doing. </i></p>

<p><i>MaintainJ 
support was very responsive and helped us with issues we faced getting the tool 
to work with a non compliant J2EE app and any other questions we had. <u>
Overall, this is a very useful tool that can provide great value at a nominal 
price.</u></i></p>

<p><i>The tool works very well for me :</i></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>to discover the actual call trace in a graphical manner. </i> </li>
  <li><i>to generate real documentation that I can pass around (especially for 
  black box testing). </i> </li>
</ul>
<p><i>I have advised my outsourcers to use it and will start getting more licenses 
for my team members. </i> </p>

<h3><i>Awesome!!</i></h3>
        <p><i>I am part of a Java/J2EE maintenance project spanning 6000+ classes 
        from past 3 years. Having 6+ years of experience in Java it was always 
        difficult and more challenging because the code had very less 
        documentation, complex business rules, strict deadlines, growing 
        expectation from customers. There are still certain areas which still 
        baffles us as a team.<br>
        <br>
        This tool came as a blessing !! It gives immense pleasure to see the 
        sequence diagram generated for a use case at click of a button.<br>
        <br>
        Initially when trying this tool, the time it was taking to instrument a 
        package of 600 classes was not so encouraging, but thanks to you 
        Choudary for coming up with new version which instruments the classes 
        involved at runtime, yes at RUNTIME !!<br>
        <br>
        Now there is a big leap in terms of performance and also the diagrams are 
        so user friendly. This tool made my life much easier, especially for the 
        new guys in the team, they can just play around the application and 
        figure out the flow just like that !!<br>
        <br>
        Many thanks to you Choudary. Keep up the good work.<br>

<h3><i>With 32 years of this stuff behind me maybe MaintainJ will allow me a few 
more</i></h3>
<p><i>Some tools work well enough to use. Some tools work more or less as they are 
represented. This tool is better than some which I have paid huge amounts of 
money for because it just works. In attempting to understand massive systems 
which are written in event driven languages and are almost always &quot;self 
documenting&quot; (I always loved that one) it is nice to have a tool which cuts 
through the trash and provides real sequence diagrams. THANK YOU, REALLY THANK 
YOU</i></p>

<h3><i>Amazing Tool!</i></h3>
<p>
    <i>I work for a .com company that releases a new version of our software every 2 weeks. The software has different styles of architecture and is a large and complex application. When we are implementing new features, most of the time, we have to follow the design decisions that was made for that particular module. All the documentation become obsolete quickly. Thanks for MaintainJ that generates the artifacts dynamically! When I reading a diagram I can be sure that is reflecting the actual code. Your tool is AMAZING!!!

<h3> <i>A boon for developers </i> </h3>
  <i>A boon for developers working on top of an existing java application with very 
little documentation w.r.t. code (as in most of the cases). Also for people, who 
want to document the existing code with very little effort, which generally 
stops them from doing it.</i><p><i>I got to this great tool thru TSS when i was looking for a UML plug-in for 
  Eclipse. I was excited by looking at the capabilities. As i evaluated it, 
  there was no disappointment whatsoever, and the tool worked as great as it 
  claims to be. There was nothing that I wanted to be improved. (of course I do 
  have some enhancement requests now
  <img alt="Smiley" src="http://maintainj.com/smf/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15">)<br>
  <br>
  Why I think the tool is cool? Here are the answers:<br>
  <br>
  <b>Ease of use </b><br>
  - Amazingly easy to instrument your application, to apply the filters and get 
  going (thanks to the nice demos)<br>
  - Know AspectJ? You are ready to use this tool at once..<br>
  - If you understand how it works, you don't even need eclipse to instrument 
  your application. You can instrument it thru' your ant build script. Later use 
  Eclipse to view the generated diagrams.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Neat UI</b><br>
  - Neat and simple UI for sequence diagrams<br>
  - Easy to remove redundancy in diagrams <br>
  - Easy to filter out unnecessary<br>
  <br>
  <b>Performance</b><br>
  - Decent performance for an instrumented application (who cares anyways - this 
  is not in production)<br>
  - I used it with a quite big standalone application. Even big sequence 
  diagrams are not cluttered and thanks to the simplicity, there are no perf 
  issues in loading/rendering big diagrams<br>
  
  <br>
  I have used TogetherJ to create static sequence diagrams from code - and was 
  disappointed because of the cluttered UI (even after lots of filtering, even 
  with just static analysis) and some fancy stuff.<br>
  Though I do not want to compare TogetherJ and MaintainJ as they are 
  functionally different (TogetherJ has lot more features than you can imagine), 
  from a developer's point of view (in a practical scenario) MaintainJ takes the 
  prize, thanks to<br>
  - runtime generation of sequence diagrams<br>
  - neat UI (come on, since when did developers need fancy UI??)<br>
  <br>
  Congrats to Choudary for a really good job. I look forward to recommend 
  MaintainJ to my colleagues and friends.<br>

  <h3><i>A must tool to have </i> </h3>
<i>
I really like the idea behind MaintainJ. MaintainJ is using Aspect-oriented 
programming, what it does mean is that there are no need for code changes, 
MaintainJ will do the work for you. <br>
<br>
MaintainJ is easy to use, just add the AspectJ &amp; MaintainJ plug-ins to your 
eclipse, and create a MaintainJ project, then you are ready to go.<br>
<br>
MaintainJ creates sequence diagrams and class diagrams for all JAVA and J2EE 
applications at the runtime, it is really easy to see the use case, it also 
makes debugging easy.</i><p>

<h3><i>Nice and useful tool</i></h3>
<i>
This is a very good tool, easy to setup and quickly get going. In a few minutes 
I was able to get a sequence diagram to unravel a standalone app. </i>

<h3><i>A useful tool</i></h3>
<p><i>I found MaintainJ by mistake and I hope I'll continue to make this kind of 
mistakes. MaintainJ is a powerful tool that helps me in my work. It easy to 
generate sequence diagram to understand a working application. It's not always 
easy to modify an existing application without breaking something; with 
MaintainJ you can accelerate the development if used correctly. </i>

<i>Good work! </i> </p>

<h3><i>A very neat tool </i> </h3>
<p>
<i>I joined a new company recently. The code base is large but documentation is 
sparse. I use the MaintainJ plug-in along with custom changes to the ant build 
file (to weave the aspects using AspectJ ant task into the code) and lo behold 
.... I had the sequence diagram for the particular workflow. Its nice to follow 
the workflow from the ser file than stepping through via debugging.<br>
<br>
This is a splendid tool and keep up the good work. </i>

<h3><i>A good find </i> </h3>
<p>
<i>I looked to MaintainJ for use in an academic project, and found it very useful 
for explaining the &quot;magic happens&quot; parts of a multi-threaded multi-hosted 
application, to relatively inexperienced developers. I'd tried a few other 
products that claimed to produce sequence diagrams, but this was the only one 
that Just Works. It really made my day to find it. </i>

<h3><i>Very Useful Tool </i> </h3>
<p><i>I have used this tool recently on a J2EE project and found it to be very 
useful, in particular the Sequence Diagrams. I look forward to downloading and 
trying out the new version.</i></p>

<h3><i>The whole idea is really marvellous...</i></h3>
<p><i>My manager has thrown me an assignment to customize a standalone Java 
application which was developed in dirty and messy way. To make the things 
worst, there is no documentation at all! I was having difficulties to understand 
the code... and luckily, I found MaintainJ and it really help me a lot in 
tracing and debugging the application. Many thanks to MaintainJ and Choudary!<br>
<br>
Among all the issues we discussed in MaintainJ forum, I'm very interested to see 
if I'm able to export the diagrams to image files one day (which I'm still 
encounter the OutOfMemoryException). <br>
<br>
I'm very interested to see MaintainJ evolves and becomes a stable product and I 
hope to try out the next release very soon!</i></p>

<h3><i>Good work! </i> </h3>
<p><i>The whole idea is really marvelous, capturing runtime trace by AspectJ 
without touching the source code. I especially like the idea of expanding and 
collapsing the sequence, which can avoid messy diagrams. <br>
<br>
I have tried it under Eclipse 3.2 with AspectJ 1.5.2. I worked perfectly for 
both standard Java application and Web Application. <br>
<br>
However, it cannot work under IBM's RAD (Rational Application Developer 6.0), 
where eclipse is 3.0. That's not end of the world. Here is a word around. I 
installed 1.2.2 AspectJ plug-in in RAD to be able to capture the runtime trace, 
review and study the generate sequence diagrams and class diagrams under eclipse 
3.2. Of course you gotta put AspectJ runtime and MaintainJAspect.jar in your web 
project. It sounds inconvenience, but it really helps me in my work, maintaining 
a quite complicated project.<br>
<br>
Good work, Choudary </i>

<h3><i>A good plugin </i> </h3>
<p>
<i>Recently, I found this plug-in and learnt to use it in my work. 
It is ease to use and the runtime sequence diagram is very useful to me.
I use it with JADclipse. It helps me to read the source code quickly. 
I think it is a great tool. I will spend time to try it in my another work.
I look forward to downloading and trying out the new version. </i>
